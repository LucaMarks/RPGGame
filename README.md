# RPGGame
Simple 2D game made in Java using only standard libraries. This is my first big project. The biggest challenge was being able to work debug issues in such a large codebase (at least it is a large codebase to me) and being able to combine logic across different features within the game. It was really important to stay organized and practice good habits of clean code and reusability.



Game.exe runs the game

Cannot get sound to work in the .exe file for some reason
